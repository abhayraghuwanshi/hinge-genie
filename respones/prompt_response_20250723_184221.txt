Prompt:
My simple pleasures: Getting lost in a book, chasing sunsets, talking nonsense with my favorite people, and staring at the mountains till they blush. Bonus points if you can make my coffee just right and shut me up with a forehead kiss.

Let's make sure we're on the same page about: Wanting the real thing-late-night deep talks, ridiculous banter, stolen hoodies, and building something that feels like home but flirts like chaos.
Something that's non-negotiable for me is: Emotional availability, a sense of humour, and someone who shows up when it’s not easy. Oh, and if you can’t communicate… sorry babe, this ride ain’t for you

Response:
Okay, so you're all about deep talks and chaos, I get it! What's the most ridiculous thing you've ever bantered about?
